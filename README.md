The purpose of this project is to assess the causes of U.S oil and gas pipeline incidents and investigate the associated losses. The ultimate goal is to find weaknesses in the asset reliability systems of various pipeline operators in the different regions of the United States. A time series forecasting model is also developed to forecast incident activity and identify improvement/worsening of pipeline incident frequency over time.
