This project is an analysis of the data set "Oil Pipeline Accidents, 2010-Present." The goal of this project is to analyze the data
from the lens of an analyst working for a company involved in pipeline leak detection systems and predictive failure modeling. 
Particularly to provide insights on the market and determine a strategy for targeting particular operators most affected by 
failure-related down time and the associated costs.
